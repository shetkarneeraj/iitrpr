Question,Option 1,Option 2,Option 3,Option 4,Answer
What is the primary purpose of the LSTM network?,To capture short-range dependencies,To memorize certain values for a long time,To make predictions based on input data,To classify images into different categories,1
How many gates are there in an LSTM network?,2,3,4,5,2
What is the main advantage of using LSTMs over GRUs?,LSTMs are simpler to implement,GRUs are easier to scale to bigger problems,GRUs are more widely used today,LSTMs have been historically proven,3
What happens when you hook up a bunch of LSTM units in parallel?,The output gate always activates,The update gate never activates,It's relatively easy for the LSTM to have some value C0 and pass it all the way to the right,The network becomes unstable,2
Why is the LSTM network considered good at memorizing certain values?,Because of its simplicity,Because of its ability to capture long-range dependencies,Because of its small size,Because of its ability to classify images,2
What is the primary benefit of using LSTMs or GRUs to capture long-range dependencies?,They are simpler and easier to implement,They can handle longer sequence lengths,They can capture much longer range dependencies,They are more computationally expensive,3
How many gates does an LSTM have compared to a GRU?,One less gate,The same number of gates,Two additional gates,Three less gates,2
What happens when you hook up multiple LSTMs or GRUs in parallel?,They lose their ability to capture long-range dependencies,They become more computationally expensive,They can pass a constant value through the network,They are unable to handle longer sequence lengths,3
Why do LSTMs and GRUs tend to be preferred over other RNN variants?,They are more computationally expensive,They can only capture short-range dependencies,They have been historically proven to work well,They are less stable,3
What is the primary difference between GRUs and LSTMs?,GRUs are simpler but may not perform as well.,GRUs are more computationally expensive but still very good, GRUs are only on a t-1,GRUs use only current input xt,GRUs do not work as well but they are called Gated LSTM,2
What is a key advantage of using LSTMs over GRUs for capturing long-range dependencies?,LSTMs are simpler to implement,GRUs are easier to scale to large problems,LSTMs have been historically more proven in performance,Both models are equally effective,2
How many gates does an LSTM network typically have?,One gate,Two gates,Three gates,Four gates,3
What is the purpose of using a t-1 and x_t to compute gate values in LSTMs?,To simplify the network architecture,To increase model capacity,To combine input and hidden state information,To reduce computational complexity,3
What is a common application of LSTMs and GRUs in deep learning?,Image classification,Natural language processing,Time series forecasting,Speech recognition,2
Why might GRUs be gaining popularity over LSTMs in recent years?,GRUs are simpler to implement but less effective,GRUs are more scalable but less proven in performance,GRUs are easier to train and optimize than LSTMs,GRUs are a better suited for problems where long-term dependencies are the main feature of the input,2
What is a key feature of LSTMs that allows them to capture long-range dependencies?,They have three gates instead of two.,They use a simpler architecture than GRUs.,They can memorize certain values for a long time.,They are not suitable for big problems.,2
What is the main difference between LSTMs and GRUs?,LSTMs have more gates than GRUs.,GRUs are simpler to train than LSTMs.,GRUs are faster to compute than LSTMs.,GRUs are a subset of LSTMs.,2
What is the purpose of the `tarnish` variable in the LSTM diagram?,It represents the input at time t-1.,It represents the output at time t.,It represents the value stored in the memory cell.,It represents the gate values.,1
What is the result of connecting a series of LSTMs in parallel?,They will not be able to capture long-range dependencies.,They will be able to memorize certain values for a long time.,They will be faster to compute than LSTMs.,The LSTM or GRU will be able to,2
